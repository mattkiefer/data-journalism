# Illinois traffic stops
## A data journalism practice rig
Since 2004, Illinois has required police officers to record data on traffic stops, including the race of the driver, the reason for the stop and the outcome, among other data points.  

Twenty years later, journalists with WBEZ and the Investigative Project on Race and Equity compiled this database of every traffic stop reported to the state during that time, publishing a series of stories along with training materials to demonstrate how to use this information.  

This repository includes a version of the complete 46 million-row database, updated through 2024, along with documentation to help you understand how to investigate further. Along the way, youâ€™ll learn practical components of data journalism, including sorting/filtering, grouping, joining, measuring change over time.
